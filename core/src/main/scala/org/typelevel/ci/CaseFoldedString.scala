/** A case folded `String`. This is a `String` which has been converted into a
  * state which is suitable for case insensitive matching under the Unicode
  * standard.
  *
  * This type differs from [[CIString]] in that it does ''not'' retain the
  * original input `String` value. That is, this is a destructive
  * transformation. You should use [[CaseFoldedString]] instead of
  * [[CIString]] when you only want the case insensitive `String` and you
  * never want to return the `String` back into the input value. In such cases
  * [[CaseFoldedString]] will be more efficient than [[CIString]] as it only
  * has to keep around a single `String` in memory.
  *
  * Case insensitive `String` values under Unicode are not always intuitive,
  * especially on the JVM. There are three character cases to consider, lower
  * case, upper case, and title case, and not all Unicode codePoints have all
  * 3, some only have 2, some only 1. For some codePoints, the JRE standard
  * operations don't always work as you'd expect.
  *
  * {{{
  * scala> val codePoint: Int = 8093
  * val codePoint: Int = 8093
  *
  * scala> new String(Character.toChars(codePoint))
  * val res0: String = ᾝ
  *
  * scala> res0.toUpperCase
  * val res1: String = ἭΙ
  *
  * scala> res0.toUpperCase.toLowerCase == res0.toLowerCase
  * val res2: Boolean = false
  *
  * scala> Character.getName(res0.head)
  * val res3: String = GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA AND OXIA AND PROSGEGRAMMENI
  *
  * scala> res0.toUpperCase.toLowerCase.equalsIgnoreCase(res0.toLowerCase)
  * val res4: Boolean = false
  * }}}
  *
  * In this example, given the Unicode character \u1f9d, converting it to
  * upper case, then to lower case, is not equal under normal String
  * equality. `String.equalsIgnoreCase` also does not work correctly by the
  * Unicode standard.
  *
  * Making matters more complicated, for certain Turkic languages, the case
  * folding rules change. See the Unicode standard for a full discussion of
  * the topic.
  *
  * @note For most `String` values the `toString` form of this is lower case
  *       (when the given character has more than one case), but this is not
  *       always the case. Certain Unicode scripts have exceptions to this and
  *       will be case folded into upper case. If you want/need an only lower
  *       case `String`, you should call `.toString.toLowerCase`.
  *
  * @see [[https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/ch05.pdf#G21790]]
