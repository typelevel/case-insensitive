/** A caseless `String`, normalized using Unicode canonical caseless matching and full case folding.
  * According to the Unicode standard this is the "most correct" method of caseless matching. If you
  * are looking for a caseless/case insensitive `String` and have no other requirements, you should
  * either use this or [[CIString]]. The difference between the two is that [[CIString]] keeps a
  * reference to the original input `String` (before normalization and case folding), and this type
  * does not. If you don't need the original input `String` value, just a caseless version of it,
  * this type will be more efficient in terms of computation and memory for ''most'' applications.
  *
  * "Full" case folding can change the number of code points in the input string.
  *
  * "Canonical" has a specific meaning in Unicode. From the standard,
  *
  * {{{
  * Canonical equivalence is a fundamental equivalency between characters
  * or sequences of characters which represent the same abstract character,
  * and which when correctly displayed should always have the same visual
  * appearance and behavior.
  * }}}
  *
  * The definition of canonical caseless equivalence in Unicode is,
  *
  * {{{
  * D145 A string X is a canonical caseless match for a string Y if and only if:
  *      NFD(toCasefold(NFD(X))) = NFD(toCasefold(NFD(Y )))
  * }}}
  *
  * Where "NFD" is the function which performs "Canonical Decomposition" and "toCasefold" is one, of
  * several, case folding operations. This type uses full case folding, without the special rules
  * for some Turkic languages.
  *
  * Thus, the `String` in this type is the result of applying `NFD(toCasefold(NFD(X)))` to the input
  * `String`, `X`.
